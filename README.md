# Dot Destroyer

This is a remake of a game I made in 2018 using the [LÃ–VE](https://love2d.org/) framework for Lua. This time, it's in Rust using [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/).

## Building from source

There are currently no binaries available for the game, but if you wish to compile it yourself, you will have to download the Rust compiler.
